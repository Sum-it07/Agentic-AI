                "## Overview\n",
                "This notebook walks through fine-tuning the TinyLlama language model on the IMDB movie review dataset so it can perform sentiment analysis. The workflow stays fully local, making it practical for laptops or desktops without high-end GPUs.\n",
                "\n",
                "## Objectives\n",
                "- Prepare the IMDB dataset for supervised fine-tuning\n",
                "- Apply LoRA so only a small fraction of the model parameters are updated\n",
                "- Train and evaluate the adapted model on local hardware\n",
                "- Compare the model before and after fine-tuning to verify the improvement\n",
                "\n",
                "## Notebook Roadmap\n",
                "1. Environment setup: install the libraries and import the components needed later\n",
                "2. Data loading: fetch the IMDB sentiment dataset and format it for instruction-style prompts\n",
                "3. Baseline run: test the original model to capture pre-training behaviour\n",
                "4. Model preparation: configure TinyLlama and attach LoRA adapters\n",
                "5. Training loop: fine-tune on a short subset of labeled reviews\n",
                "6. Inference checks: run the adapted model on held-out examples\n",
                "7. Result review: contrast baseline and fine-tuned predictions\n",
                "\n",
                "## Concepts to Know\n",
                "- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) updates small adapter matrices instead of full model weights\n",
                "- Instruction tuning frames each training example as an instruction-response pair to guide the model\n",
                "- The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews split into positive and negative examples\n",
                "- CPU-only training works, but expect longer runtimes than on a GPU\n",
                "\n",
                "## Toolkit\n",
                "- Model: TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) for a manageable yet capable baseline\n",
                "- Training stack: Hugging Face Transformers, TRL (SFTTrainer), and PEFT for adapter management\n",
                "- Hardware: runs on CPU or modest GPU (4 GB+ VRAM recommended)\n",
                "- Outputs: LoRA adapter files in the 10–50 MB range instead of multi-gigabyte checkpoints\n",
                "\n",
                "## When This Notebook Helps\n",
                "- You need a reproducible example of lightweight fine-tuning\n",
                "- You plan to adapt language models for sentiment or classification tasks\n",
                "- You want a reference workflow for running production-style experiments on personal hardware\n",

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n",
